                Breaking the Habit of Love Addiction

                Our relationships are mirror images of who we are. 
                They reflect how we think and feel about ourselves. 
                What we were taught in childhood is often carried with us through<span id="dots">...
                </span><span id="more">life. This point is driven home with the choices we make in our relationships.
                    Our experiences shape our view of the world and ultimately whether we view ourselves as worthy or lovable. 
                    The old adage, “We are the company we keep” holds true here. Thus, if we grew up in a healthy environment, 
                    then the relationships we have with ourselves and others should be relatively healthy. 
                    The opposite holds true if we grew up receiving conditional love or love mixed with indifference or shame. 
                    Being raised in a toxic environment is often the blueprint for low self-esteem, 
                    lack of self-worth and a cycle of unhealthy relationships.<br/><br/>While most were raised being taught that they can’t love another until they first love themselves, 
                    some may have grown up being told to love themselves without being taught how to love themselves. 
                    For those raised with hypocrisy, neediness and dependency often replace intimacy and healthy attachments. 
                    In this situation, relationships are often approached from the perspective that their partner will somehow “fix” or complete them. 
                    Relationships may be romanticized as hoping for the “fairytale” ending (i.e. “In love with being in love”). 
                    Any emotional investment in the relationship is exchanged for the thrill of the chase. Often when the chase stops, 
                    the relationship stops.<br/><br/>A partner may be abandoned in an effort to avoid being abandoned themselves or when boredom sets in. 
                    When one relationship ends, another is often quickly secured. 
                    They may convince themselves that “this time things will be different” or “this time things will work out.” Unfortunately, 
                    wishful thinking without self-awareness or positive habit change is an unhealthy cycle at best, and self-sabotaging behavior at worst.
